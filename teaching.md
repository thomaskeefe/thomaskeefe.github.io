I have served as primary instructor and instructional assistant for several statistics courses at UNC, listed here. Teaching has been an enriching and fulfilling experience for me, and has helped me grow as a technical communicator and educator. I'm proud to offer my students' evaluation of my teaching below.

<h2>Courses taught as primary instructor:</h2><br>
<h3>STOR 455: Methods of Data Analysis, Spring 2022</h3><br>
    STOR 455 focuses on multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, with modeling and calcuation done in R/RStudio. Student course evaluations available <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/KeefeCourseEval_STOR455_SP2022.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>STOR 155: Introduction to Data Models and Inference, Spring & Summer 2021</h3><br>
    STOR 155 is an introductory statistics course, focusing on descriptive statistics, data visualization, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for means and proportions, and simple linear regression. Calculations are done in Excel.

    <!-- In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, I lost my internship at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a> and in turn signed onto a teaching position for UNC's Summer Session I.  Due to health concerns related to the pandemic, all teaching was remote.  I designed my course in a way that I believed would make the difficult and sudden transition to remote learning as painless as possible for my students, while still demanding diligence and genuine mastery of the material.  <br><br>
    The foundation of my course was a daily routine of a 1 hour live lecture, a shorter video supplementary lecture, and an online homework assignment using the online portal <a href="https://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a>.  Myself, and my team of four instructor's assistants, spread out over 38 office hours throughout the week every week.  Since I wanted to maximize the amount of practice available to my students, much of my work this summer involved developing <a href="https://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a> questions in Perl.  For those interested in learning Perl code for <a href="https://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a> development, I have attached three useful examples for developing your own questions.  I am quite a fan of questions where you simply give a student a set of data and have them perform analysis and inference.  The first of these examples shows a way in which one can do this, and how to use continuous distributions in Perl.  The second outlines using discrete probability distributions in Perl, and includes my own implementation of the Negative Binomial CDF.  The third is a diversity question (see statement below). The fourth gives 5 different sets of data and asks students which pairs satisfy the conditions for least squares regression. <br><br>

    <u>Statement about Diversity in the Statistics Classroom:</u> While leveraging the diverse perspectives of students in the classroom is one of UNC's pillars of teaching, this can be a tricky thing to do in a quantitative class.  In an attempt to integrate the many exciting perspectives brought by my students into our learning, I incorporated each of my students' worldviews into our homework/exam questions and our in-class examples.  See <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirmurphalot/sirmurphalot.github.io/master/_assignments/Perl1.txt">Webassign Perl Code Example 3</a> for a question I used on our first homework assignment to garner this information from my students.  This semester was certainly a trial run of this idea; I can say now that I am very pleased with the results!  Besides making my students feel more included, it was quite enjoyable to learn more about what is important to each of them.
